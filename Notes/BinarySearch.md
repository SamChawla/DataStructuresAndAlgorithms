## Overview

- Binary search is a search algorithm where we find the position of a target value by comparing the middle value with this target value.
- If the middle value is equal to the target value, then we have our solution (we have found the position of our target value).
- If the target value comes before the middle value, we look for the target value in the left half.
Otherwise, we look for the target value in the right half.
- We repeat this process as many times as needed, until we find the target value.

## TIme complexity of binary search

In big-O notation, we would say that the time complexity is: __O(log<sub>2</sub>(n)).__
