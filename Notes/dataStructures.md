# DSA

What are Data Structures?

- The logical or mathematical model of a particular organization of data is called *data structures*.
- data structures are different ways of organizing data on your computer/memory, that can be used efficiently.

Different data structures:

- Arrays
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Graph
- Hashing

---

What are algorithms?

- Set of steps to accoumplish a task.
- Set of rules for a computer program to accomplish a task.

What makes a good algorithms?

- Correctness and Efficiency.

Why DSA is important?

- Lets take an example of a library. Imagine a room full of unorganized books. Here, it is not possible to find a book that you want efficiently. Now, if we want to find a book in a library say `Algorithms 3rd edition`. So, you will go to CS section, then Algorithms section, then if the books are sorted by name, start looking for the book. so, it becomes much easier to find the book.

Here, books are the data, arranging them is data structures and steps to find the book is algorithm.
