# Algorithms

- It is a sequence of finite steps used to solve a particular problem.
e.g

```code
Multiply(){
    1. Take 2 numbers (a,b)
    2. Multiply a and b and store in c.
    3. return c
}
```

Properties of algorithms:

- It should terminate after finite steps.
- It should produce atleast one output.
- It is independent of any programming language.
- It should be unabmbigious(Deteministic).
